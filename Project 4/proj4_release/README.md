# CS 6476 project 4: [Scene Recognition with Bag-of-Words](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/proj4/)

# Setup
- Install Anaconda / Miniconda
- Create a conda environment using the given file: `conda env create -f environment_<OS>.yml`
- This should create an environment named `cs6476p4`. Activate it using `activate cs6476p4`

Note: I have changed the jupyter file and "utils" file a little bit, so you should use these files to run my code. However, this is only required for cross validation. You can still run the initial jupyter file with my student code and initial utils file. 
Also, it was not possible to add vocab_10000.pkl because it was more than 10MB. Let me know if you needed that file. I have it in my end.
Thanks.
