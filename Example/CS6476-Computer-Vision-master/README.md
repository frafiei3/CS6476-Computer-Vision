You must separately download MatConvNet 1.0 beta 16.

It appears that MatConvNet was updated to beta 17 while this project was released and the example networks reformatted to be incompatible with beta 16. Here is VGG-F (233MB) in a format that will work with beta 16 (needed for part 2)

MatConvNet isn't precompiled like VLFeat, so we compiled it for you. Here are the mex files for CPU-only usage for 64bit Windows, MacOS, and Linux: MatConvNet64mex.zip (.5 MB). The files go [MatConvNetPath]/matlab/mex/
